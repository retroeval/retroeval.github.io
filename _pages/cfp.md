# Call for Papers

## Symposium Theme
[Ehud Reiter](https://ehudreiter.com) has been a leading light in Natural Language Generation (NLG) research throughout the four decades he worked in this area, in both academia (Aberdeen) and industry (CoGenTech; Arria NLG). Ehud’s influence extends to all aspects of NLG, but the areas in which it has arguably been the strongest is evaluation of NLG systems. On the occasion of his retirement, this workshop, which is held in his honour, will therefore focus on evaluation of NLG systems, highlighting in particular some of the topics that Ehud has tended to emphasize (see below) such as the importance of reproducibility and the risks of data contamination.


## Topics of Interest
Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:

* The aims of NLG and NLG evaluation
* Intrinsic versus extrinsic NLG evaluation
* Evaluation of NLG systems in the real world
* Impact assessment of NLG systems and LLMs
* New evaluation challenges arising from the use of LLMs
* Hallucination annotation and its role in NLG evaluation
* Statistical analysis for NLG evaluations
* Data contamination in NLG evaluation
* LLMs as evaluators: opportunities and pitfalls
* The role of LLMs in the development of evaluation metrics
* Reproduction and reproducibility of human evaluation experiments
* Publication bias: What to do with negative results?
* Pre-publication of research hypotheses in NLG evaluation
* NLG evaluation versus psycholinguistic experimentation: what can we learn from each other?
* Disciplinary cultures and evaluation methods
* Evaluating NLG systems/LLMs for assistive technology
